# CZ1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

## Mini Project Title: Can we predict happiness? 

In this module, I have learnt basic data handling, statistics, exploratory data analysis, linear regression, classification trees, clustering algorithms, data visualization and dashboards in Python.

In this project, I worked in a team of 3 (myself, Min Hui, Ezekiel) to tackle the question: Can we predict happiness? 

The dataset used in this project is the [World Happiness Record 2019](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/).

We made use of a 2 pronged method to approach the problem. 

Firstly, we made use of multi-variate and uni-variate linear regression to find the most significant variable used in predicting happiness scores. 

Secondly, we made use of a neural network to predict happiness scores, to find out how accurately we can predict happiness.

The entire project resides in the Python Jupyter notebook files.
